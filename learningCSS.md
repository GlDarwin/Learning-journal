There is an invisible box around every html element

css allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box is presented

block level elements are shown with red borders, and inline elements have green borders

using css you could add borders around any of the boxes

css treats each html element as if it appers inside its own box and use rules to indicate how that element should look

<css rules usually apper in a separate document>

a css rule contains two parts: a selector and declaration
